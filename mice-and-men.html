<span class="tab"></span>In most action movies, a hero has a plan that nearly never goes wrong. When people watch those kinds of movies, they end up thinking that their plans are just as impregnable. The problem is that life doesn’t work like that. Believing a plan will work, doesn’t always mean that the plan will actually come to fruition. “Even the best laid plans of mice and men go aft astray and leave us nothing but grief and pain for promised joy!” says Robert Burns in his poem “To a Mouse”. This quote means that just because one “believes” in a plan does not always mean it will come true. The characters in Of Mice and Men, by John Steinbeck, are all (unwitting) examples of this. Everyone has their “best laid plans”, but oftentimes it fails, leaving “nothing but grief and pain for promised joy!” The three characters in the story that personify this quote are Curley, George Milton, and Lennie Small.<br>
                        <!-- END_MAIN -->
                        <span class="tab"></span>First, Curley is the best example of this quote because he says he was “tough” but actually was not. Candy, a character that dislikes Curley, muses: “Well... tell you what. Curley's like a lot of little guys. He hates big guys. He's alla time picking scraps with big guys. Kind of like he's mad at 'em because he ain't a big guy … S'pose Curley jumps a big guy an' licks him. Ever'body says what a game guy Curley is. And s'pose he does the same thing and gets licked. Then ever'body says the big guy oughtta pick somebody his own size, and maybe they gang up on the big guy. Never did seem right to me. Seems like Curley ain't givin' nobody a chance” (26). Curley wants to be looked up as the “tough guy” by everybody else; he wants to be viewed as “superior”. To keep up the illusion that he is “superior”, he likes to mistreat or bully people that he has prejudices against (such as Lennie and Crooks). He likes to taunt them, put them in difficult scenarios, and start fights with them. In the case of the latter, his strategy backfired on him: “Lennie was still smiling with delight at the memory of the ranch. Curley stepped over to Lennie like a terrier. ‘What the hell you laughin' at?’ Lennie looked blankly at him. ‘Huh?’ Then Curley's rage exploded. ‘Come on, ya big bastard. Get up on your feet. No big son-of-a-bitch is gonna laugh at me. I'll show ya who's yella’” (63). Curley wants a “risk free” scenario: a situation where he can’t possibly lose. The crowd in the bunkhouse seems pretty “tough” to Curley, so he avoids them. Then, he finds Lennie smiling. He thought that Lennie was like an elephant: big, but docile. However, even elephants can cause a huge amount of damage, and in this case, the result was Curley’s mangled hand and the loss of his ego. The ultimate failure came when right after his wife died: “Curley came suddenly to life. ‘I know who done it,’ he cried. ‘That big son-of-a-bitch done it. I know he done it. Why- ever'body else was out there playin' horseshoes.’ He worked himself into a fury. ‘I'm gonna get him. I'm going for my shotgun. I'll kill the big son-of-a-bitch myself. I'll shoot 'im in the guts. Come on, you guys.’ He ran furiously out of the barn” (96). To the casual inspection, his behavior might seem normal for someone who had lost a loved one: anger and indignation. However, he focuses on Lennie more than his wife, and that’s why he leaves the barn without a second glance to his wife. Curley proves that he is not such a “tough guy” when he puts revenge in front of doing what’s right (in this case, calling the police). In consequence, Curley wants others to respect him as a “tough guy”, but the dream crashes down around his ears, similar to two other characters in this story.<br>
                        <span class="tab"></span>Second, George Milton and Lennie Small have the dream of buying their own land, but that aspiration becomes an unreasonable fantasy later on. George explains, “An' it'd be our own, an' nobody could can us. If we don't like a guy we can say, ‘Get the hell out,’ and by God he's got to do it. An' if a fren' come along, why we'd have an extra bunk, an' we'd say, ‘Why don't you spen' the night?’ an' by God he would. We'd have a setter dog and a couple stripe cats, but you gotta watch out them cats don't get the little rabbits” (45). George’s quest for land echos his deeper desire for independence. For his entire life, he has bounced around from farm to farm, doing lots of work to benefit his employer. His ultimate goal is to have some scrap of power, however small it is. His thirst for autonomy eclipses even the temptation of drinking and gambling in the town. Lennie’s goal, on the other hand, is less fundamental than that: “An' live off the fatta the lan' ... An' have rabbits. … Tell [me] about what we're gonna have in the garden and about the rabbits in the cages and about the rain in the winter and the stove, and how thick the cream is on the milk like you can hardly cut it. Tell about that, George” (12). At first, it may seem like Lennie’s goal is to just take care of rabbits and small animals. But it goes deeper than that. Lennie has always been bossed around by George, being told that he could do this, but not that. For example, in the past, he was never allowed to pet mice in his pocket because George told him not to. With the creation of his rabbit hutch, he could be independent for once, since George did not seem to have any intention of interfering with his rabbit hutch. However, their plan didn’t work out like it was supposed to. In the end, Lennie’s conscience, which manifested itself as his own Aunt Clara, said: “You're always sayin' that, an' you know sonofabitching well you ain't never gonna do it. You'll jus' stick around an' stew the b'Jesus outa George all the time.’ Lennie said, ‘I might jus' as well go away. George ain't gonna let me tend no rabbits now” (105). Lennie realizes that his hopeful dream had come to naught; the fantasy that he has once cherished in his mind was now gone. He realizes that he has done something terrible. Even though he says it was just an accident, he realizes that nobody will believe his side of the story and George will probably side with them too. A few minutes later, Lennie’s life was ended, in an act of mercy, by George. <br>
                        <span class="tab"></span>To conclude, Curley, Lennie, and George all had their “best laid schemes”, but they failed, leaving them clutching to the “grief and pain for promised joy”. We as a society live in a world filled with hurdles, pitfalls, and setbacks. The only way to deal with those are to create a plan to go around it or to achieve it. And when those schemes don’t go as planned, tragedy ensues. Curley, Lennie, and George all had their own plans for the future, but it only ends up with them losing everything. Plans big and small are made constantly day to day, but only a small fraction actually come to fruition; most become just evanescent delusions. As we as a society all look back on our plans at the end of the day, our dreams are laid bare before us. Dreams that are never fulfilled. <br>
